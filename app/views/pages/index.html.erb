<p>I’m a big fan of this technique to make Sass talk to JavaScript. Because we declare breakpoints as a multidimensional list with their names as keys, exporting them in bulk to JavaScript becomes really straightforward and can be done automatically with just a few lines of code.
  I’m not trying to put down other people’s solutions and I’m definitely not saying this one is better. I mentioned them to show some of the obstacles I found along the way to my ideal solution, as well as some great things they introduced that inspired my own solution.
  You might have some concerns about the length and complexity of this implementation. While I understand, the idea behind it is that you download one single file, @import it into your project and start using it without having to touch the source code. Ping me on Twitter though if you have any questions.
  You can get it from GitHub and you are very welcome to contribute with issues/code/love. I’m sure there’s still a lot we can do to make it better.</p>
